The English word ‘time’ may refer to a more or less closely defined period, from ‘a short time’, meaning not very long, to ‘the time of the Pharaohs’, some three thousand years; it may also refer to the ‘indefinite continuous duration’, as the Oxford English Dictionary expresses it, in which all events have taken place, are taking place, and will take place. This notion, the focus of Plotinus’ and St Augustine’s perplexity, presupposes a developed capacity for abstract thought; not only are various primitive peoples reported by anthropologists not to have such a concept of time, but in the epics ascribed to ‘Homer’ and dating from the 8th to 7th centuries bc that the Greeks regarded as the foundation of their culture, chrónos denotes only a lapse of time, not what we are tempted to think of as time itself. Nevertheless it already has that sense in the great Athenian lawgiver Solon of the early 6th century bc, who personifies it as a judge: ‘in the court of Time’. Since then, this concept of indefinite continuous duration has been so familiar a concept to Western civilization that we find its absence unimaginable in any advanced culture; yet the case has recently been argued that neither the Hebrew Bible nor rabbinical literature displays it. However, in any but the simplest society, even if people are unaware of time as a thing in itself, they need to measure it. This book is about the methods by which the passage of time has been measured.
